Title: Welcome to the House of Commons at DHAP 2026!
Date:

On this page, you will be able to find periodic updates issued by relevant media outlets, authorities, or persons with the intention of driving council debate in the correct direction. MPs are highly encouraged to respond to these updates promptly and ensure that the negative consequences of the primary update do not materialise. On the second page, you may also find the approval ratings of the 6 party leaders, alongside key economic indicators detailing the state of the British Economy. The full range of economic indicators alongside their values will be added by Day 1 of the Conference. Changes will be made to both graphs at the discretion of the dais, with only major updates being announced for the council's collective viewing. MPs are encouraged to refresh this page frequently to ensure that they respond promptly to any new updates or changes to the economic/political state of the UK.

The fate of Britain is on your shoulders. Good luck!
